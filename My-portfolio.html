      <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>
      <p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>
     <p> We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p> 
     <p> Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and this one sit on the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements will <span> wrap onto a new line</span> if possible (like this one containing text), or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do.</p>
